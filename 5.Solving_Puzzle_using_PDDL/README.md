PDDL_repository
===============

My repository for PDDL programming.

In this repository you can find some PDDL files to solve several famous problems.

The planner we use is Blackbox which can be downloaded from www.cs.rochester.edu/~kautz/satplan/blackbox/.

After downloading Blackbox, you need to put Blackbox together with both the PDDL domain and problem files.

You can run the files using the command:
./blackbox -o domain.pddl -f problem.pddl
